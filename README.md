- Node.js 18 or higher

## Getting Started

   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash

## Technical Details

The application performs several steps during the transfer process:

1. **Validation**
   - Verifies GitHub URL format and repository accessibility
   - Validates Hugging Face API token
   - Checks target repository name availability

2. **Transfer Process**
   - Creates a new repository on Hugging Face Hub
   - Fetches all files from the GitHub repository
   - Uploads files to Hugging Face
   - Updates repository metadata

## Limitations

- Only supports repositories on the 'main' branch
- Binary files are not supported
- Large repositories might be affected by API rate limits
- Sequential file transfer might be slow for large repositories

## Security

- API tokens are never stored
- All operations are performed client-side
- HTTPS-only API communication
- Input validation and sanitization
